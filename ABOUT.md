# ABOUT SCHROEDINGER

**A local-first knowledge instrument where thoughts exist in superposition until observed.**

---

## One Paragraph

Schroedinger is a personal knowledge system that runs entirely on your computer. Your thoughts are stored as plain markdown files—no database lock-in, no cloud sync, no account. The software provides an interactive canvas where notes have physics: they drift randomly, attract based on semantic similarity, collide to form unexpected connections, and develop their own behaviors over time. The core thesis is that determinism is the enemy of discovery. Every feature exists to introduce controlled randomness—to create conditions for emergence, for insights you couldn't have predicted.

## Key Principles

1. **Randomness as Engine** — Stochastic drift, collision events, and semantic gravity create unpredictable encounters
2. **Local-First** — Your data never leaves your machine. Plain markdown files, SQLite cache
3. **Ancient Formats** — Markdown and SQLite will exist in 50 years. Your notes will too
4. **Physics of Thought** — Mass (importance), entropy (freshness), semantic gravity (meaning)
5. **Object Agency** — Knowledge objects develop memory, relationships, and behavioral traits
6. **Withered Technology** — Proven, boring tech used in radical ways

## How It Works

```
You write thoughts as markdown → 
  Bridge watches files, generates embeddings → 
    Lens displays as physics objects → 
      Drift brings random encounters → 
        Collisions prompt synthesis → 
          Objects remember and evolve →
            Emergence happens
```

## Core Experience

1. **Drift** — Objects move when you're not looking, based on entropy
2. **Collide** — Random encounters force you to find connections  
3. **Snap** — Name the connection, create a synthesis
4. **Release** — New thought enters the system with high entropy
5. **Evolve** — Objects develop traits based on their history

| Layer | Stack |
|-------|-------|
| Substrate | Markdown files + SQLite |
| Bridge | Node.js + Hono + ONNX Runtime |
| Lens | Svelte 5 + PixiJS 8 + matter.js |

## What This Is Not

- Not a note-taking app (no editor, no organization)
- Not a search engine (discovery over retrieval)
- Not a graph database (physics over hierarchy)
- Not a cloud service (local-first always)
- Not deterministic (surprise over control)

## Inspirations

- **Mark Cerny**: Find the fun at the smallest loop first
- **Gunpei Yokoi**: Lateral thinking with withered technology
- **Fischli & Weiss**: Do one thing at a time. Be calm. Smile.
- **Gödel**: Embrace incompleteness. Visualize the voids.

## Status

**v0.1.0** — Working prototype with:
- File sync and embedding generation
- Physics canvas with drag, collision, synthesis
- Memory system with traits and relationships
- Semantic gravity and autonomous behaviors
- Search, create, edit UI

## The Contract

Your files are sacred. The software is disposable.  
The markdown is the truth. The database is a cache.  
The randomness is ours. The emergence is yours.
