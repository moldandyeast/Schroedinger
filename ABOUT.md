# ABOUT SCHROEDINGER

**A local-first knowledge instrument where thoughts exist in superposition until observed.**

## One Paragraph

Schroedinger is a personal knowledge system that runs entirely on your computer. Your thoughts are stored as plain markdown files—no database lock-in, no cloud sync, no account. The software provides multiple *lenses*: interactive interfaces where notes have physics, drift randomly, attract based on semantic similarity, collide to form unexpected connections, and develop their own behaviors over time. The core thesis is that determinism is the enemy of discovery.

## Key Principles

1. **File over App** — Your markdown files are the truth. The software is disposable.
2. **Randomness as Engine** — Stochastic drift and collision events create unpredictable encounters.
3. **Local-First** — Your data never leaves your machine. Plain files, SQLite cache.
4. **Ancient Formats** — Markdown and SQLite will exist in 50 years. Your notes will too.
5. **Physics of Thought** — Mass (importance), entropy (freshness), semantic gravity (meaning).
6. **Object Agency** — Knowledge objects develop memory, relationships, and behavioral traits.
7. **Withered Technology** — Proven, boring tech used in radical ways.

## The Lenses

Schroedinger provides multiple ways to interact with your knowledge:

| Lens | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Drift** | The physics canvas. Objects wander, collide, synthesize. |
| **Observe** | Watch the system evolve without intervention. |
| **Accelerator** | Focused collision experiments to find connections. |
| **Void** | Map the embedding space. See what's missing. |
| **Archive** | Browse and search. The traditional view. |

Each lens is a different instrument for the same data.

## How It Works

```
You write markdown files →
  Bridge watches files, generates embeddings →
    Lens displays as physics objects →
      Drift brings random encounters →
        Collisions prompt synthesis →
          Objects remember and evolve →
            Emergence happens
```

## Core Experience

1. **Drift** — Objects move when you're not looking, based on entropy
2. **Collide** — Random encounters force you to find connections
3. **Snap** — Name the connection, create a synthesis
4. **Release** — New thought enters the system with high entropy
5. **Evolve** — Objects develop traits based on their history

## Technology

| Layer | Stack |
|-------|-------|
| Substrate | Markdown files + SQLite |
| Bridge | Node.js + Hono + ONNX Runtime |
| Lens | Svelte + PixiJS + matter.js |

## What This Is Not

- Not a note-taking app (discovery over organization)
- Not a search engine (serendipity over retrieval)
- Not a graph database (physics over hierarchy)
- Not a cloud service (local-first always)
- Not deterministic (surprise over control)

## The Contract

Your files are sacred. The software is disposable.
The markdown is the truth. The database is a cache.
The randomness is ours. The emergence is yours.
