# Lateral Thinking with Withered Technology

Gunpei Yokoi was an engineer at Nintendo. While other companies chased cutting-edge technology, Yokoi advocated for a different approach:

> Take mature, well-understood, cheap technology and use it in radical new ways.

This philosophy produced the Game Boy. Competitors built color handhelds with expensive screens and short battery life. Yokoi used a simple monochrome LCD from the calculator industry.

The technology was "withered"—boring, proven, unglamorous. But the application was revolutionary.

We apply this to knowledge management. Markdown and SQLite are boring. That's the point.
