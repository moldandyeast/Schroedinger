# Gödel's Incompleteness and Knowledge Systems

In 1931, Kurt Gödel proved something devastating about formal systems: any system powerful enough to describe basic arithmetic contains statements that are true but unprovable within the system.

Completeness and consistency are mutually exclusive. You can have one or the other, never both.

Most knowledge software ignores this. Databases demand consistency. Tagging systems demand completeness. Every thought must be categorized.

But knowledge isn't a formal system that can be made complete. There are always thoughts you haven't had yet. Always gaps in the map.

**Schroedinger embraces incompleteness.** We visualize the voids—the empty spaces where knowledge should exist but doesn't. The gaps are research questions waiting to happen.
