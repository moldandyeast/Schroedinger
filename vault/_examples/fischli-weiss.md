# How to Work Better

In 1991, the Swiss artists Peter Fischli and David Weiss installed a simple text piece on the wall of a factory in Zurich:

1. Do one thing at a time
2. Know the problem
3. Learn to listen
4. Learn to ask questions
5. Distinguish sense from nonsense
6. Accept change
7. Admit mistakes
8. Say it simple
9. Be calm
10. Smile

These instructions are deceptively profound. They're not about productivity—they're about presence. About engaging with work as a practice rather than a race.

Schroedinger adopts this sensibility. The interface is calm. There are no notifications, no badges, no "you've fallen behind" warnings.

The void is luminous, not dark. The motion is slow, not urgent.
