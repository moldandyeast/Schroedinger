# The Case for Randomness

Determinism is the enemy of discovery.

When you search for something, you find what you expected. When you navigate by folder, you see what you organized. When you follow a link, you go where you intended. Every action has a predictable result.

But insight doesn't come from obedience. Insight comes from accident. From stumbling across something you forgot. From juxtapositions you didn't plan.

Most software eliminates randomness. It's seen as a bug—unpredictable behavior, chaotic state, things moving when they shouldn't.

We want the opposite.

Every feature in Schroedinger exists to introduce controlled randomness—to create conditions for **emergence**.
