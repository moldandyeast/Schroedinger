# The Mark Cerny Method

Find the fun at the smallest possible scale, then build outward.

Most development goes wrong in the middle. You build infrastructure for months before you know if the core experience works. You're betting everything on an untested premise.

Cerny inverts this. He starts with a "first playable"—the simplest possible prototype that contains the core mechanic. Is the jump satisfying? Does it *feel* right? If not, fix it now. If so, build outward.

For Schroedinger, the core mechanic is the **collision**. If dragging two notes together doesn't feel good, no amount of features will save it.
