# Welcome to Schroedinger

This is your first Knowledge Object. It exists in superposition—full of potential connections you haven't made yet.

Create more thoughts. Let them drift. Watch them collide.

The goal is not to organize. The goal is to discover what you already know but haven't realized yet.

*Determinism is the enemy of discovery.*
