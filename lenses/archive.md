# Archive

*Browse and search. The traditional view.*

## What It Is

Archive is the fallback. A conventional file browser and search interface for when you need to find something specific without the physics simulation.

This is **utility mode**. No drift, no collisions, just your files in a list.

## Coming Soon

This lens is under development.

### Planned Features

- **List view**: All KOs sorted by title, date, or observation count
- **Full-text search**: Find content within files
- **Tag filtering**: Filter by frontmatter tags
- **Bulk operations**: Select multiple files for batch actions
- **Sort options**: By name, date modified, entropy, observation count
- **Quick preview**: See file contents without leaving the list

## Philosophy

Sometimes you just need to find a file.

The physics simulation is the heart of Schroedinger, but it's not always the right tool. When you know exactly what you're looking for, Archive gets you there fast.

But even Archive maintains the file-over-app philosophy. You're still looking at your markdown files. No lock-in. No proprietary format.

## Design Principles

1. **Speed**: Instant search, instant preview
2. **Minimal chrome**: The files are the focus
3. **Escape hatch**: Always one click from returning to Drift
4. **No surprises**: Works exactly like you'd expect

*Not every moment needs magic. Sometimes you just need a list.*
