# Observe

*Watch the system evolve. No intervention.*

---

## What It Is

Observe is the passive counterpart to Drift. The same physics simulation runs, but you cannot interact. Objects collide, and the system decides what happens automatically based on behavioral rules.

This is **pure observation**. You watch your knowledge ecosystem evolve without your intervention. What clusters form? What drifts to the edges? What collides repeatedly?

## Coming Soon

This lens is under development.

### Planned Features

- **Auto-resolution**: Collisions resolve based on object traits and history
- **Behavioral emergence**: Objects develop preferences over time
- **Milestone tracking**: Watch for emergent patterns (Ancient objects, Volatile Cascades)
- **Time controls**: Speed up, slow down, pause without breaking immersion
- **Heatmaps**: Visualize collision frequency, cluster density

## Philosophy

Sometimes the best thing you can do is stop touching things.

Observe exists because human attention is a limited resource. You can't be present for every collision. But the system can run without you, developing its own patterns and preferences.

When you return to Drift after a session in Observe, you'll find a different landscape. Some ideas will have clustered. Others will have drifted apart. The system has a memory, and that memory evolves.

## Design Questions

*These are open questions we're exploring:*

1. Should auto-resolved syntheses be marked differently?
2. How aggressive should the behavioral rules be?
3. Should Observe show you a log of what happened?
4. Can you "rewind" to see past states?

*The observer effect works both ways. Sometimes you need to stop observing to let the system evolve.*
