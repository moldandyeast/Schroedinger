# Accelerator

*Focused collision experiments. Find connections.*

---

## What It Is

The Accelerator is a focused mode for intentional discovery. Instead of waiting for random drift to create collisions, you choose an anchor object and the system brings potential collision partners to you.

This is **directed serendipity**. You're still relying on unexpected connections, but you're narrowing the search space.

## Coming Soon

This lens is under development. A basic version is available in Drift (top-right button).

### Planned Features

- **Full-screen focus mode**: Just the anchor and candidates, nothing else
- **Semantic distance visualization**: See how far apart ideas are in embedding space
- **Batch experiments**: Run multiple collision attempts in sequence
- **History**: Track which collisions you've tried and their outcomes
- **Suggestions**: System-recommended pairs based on successful past collisions

## How It Works

```
SELECT ANCHOR → GATHER CANDIDATES → COLLIDE → RECORD → REPEAT
```

1. **Select Anchor**: Choose the object you want to explore
2. **Gather Candidates**: System finds relatives (linked) and strangers (distant)
3. **Collide**: Force a meeting between anchor and candidate
4. **Record**: Snap, Dismiss, or Ignore—just like Drift
5. **Repeat**: Move to the next candidate

## Philosophy

The Accelerator exists because pure randomness isn't always efficient.

Sometimes you have a specific idea and you want to stress-test it against distant concepts. What happens when your note on "game design" meets your note on "thermodynamics"? You could wait for drift to bring them together... or you could force the collision.

But beware: too much Accelerator use makes the system deterministic. The goal is to accelerate serendipity, not eliminate it.

## Use Cases

1. **Exploring a new idea**: You just wrote something. What does it connect to?
2. **Breaking clusters**: An idea is stuck in one neighborhood. Introduce it to strangers.
3. **Bridging domains**: Find connections between separate areas of your vault.
4. **Stress-testing**: Is this idea robust? What happens when it meets its opposites?

*The accelerator is a tool, not a habit. Use it to find the unexpected, then return to drift.*
