# Void

*Map the embedding space. See what's missing.*

---

## What It Is

Void shows you the negative space in your knowledge. Using the embedding model, it maps where your ideas cluster and—more importantly—where they don't.

This is **cartography of absence**. What topics are you avoiding? What connections haven't you made? What regions of thought-space are empty?

## Coming Soon

This lens is under development.

### Planned Features

- **Embedding visualization**: 2D projection of the high-dimensional embedding space
- **Cluster detection**: Automatic identification of idea neighborhoods
- **Gap analysis**: Highlight regions with low density
- **Suggested explorations**: "You have nothing about X" prompts
- **Import suggestions**: Find external content that fills gaps

## Philosophy

Every knowledge base has blind spots. The things you don't know you don't know.

Most tools show you what you have. Void shows you what you're missing. It's uncomfortable—seeing empty regions of your thought-space—but that discomfort is generative.

The embedding model places ideas in a high-dimensional space where similar concepts are close together. By projecting this space into 2D, you can see the topology of your thinking. Clusters. Bridges. Islands. Voids.

## Potential Visualizations

*Ideas we're exploring:*

1. **Heatmap**: Color by density. Hot spots are well-explored; cold spots are voids.
2. **Terrain**: Height represents depth. Mountains of connected ideas, valleys of absence.
3. **Graph**: Traditional network view, but edges weighted by embedding similarity.
4. **Constellation**: Stars for objects, brightness for observation count. Dark regions are unexplored.

## Use Cases

1. **Finding blind spots**: What am I not thinking about?
2. **Balancing a vault**: Is my knowledge too clustered in one area?
3. **Research planning**: Where should I read next?
4. **Connecting islands**: Two clusters exist—what bridge could connect them?

*The void is not empty. It's full of what you haven't thought yet.*
